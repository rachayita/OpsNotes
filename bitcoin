 - The private key (k) is a number, usually picked at random. From the pri‐ vate key, we use elliptic curve multiplication, a one-way cryptographic function, to generate a public key (K). From the public key (K), we use a one-way cryptographic hash function to generate a bitcoin address (A).

- A private key can be applied to the digital finger‐print of a transaction to produce a numerical signature. This signature can only be produced by someone with knowledge of the private key. However, anyone with access to the public key and the transaction fingerprint can use them to verify the signature.

- keys have rangebetween 1 and 2^256  -- i total 64 hexadecimal number each 4 bit = 256 bits.
