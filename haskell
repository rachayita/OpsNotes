- When you see an = symbol in Haskell code, it represents “meaning”: the name on the left is defined to be the expression on the right.

- a variable provides a way to give a name to an expression.

- The record that we use to track an unevaluated expression is referred to as a thunk(a deferred expression).

- No subtyping or coercion polymorphism only parameterised or polymorphic type is supportd.

-  -> is right-associative.

-  The environment in which ghci operates is called the IO monad.
