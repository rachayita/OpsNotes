- Just like vectors, hash maps store their data on the heap. 

- The ? Operator Can Only Be Used in Functions That Return Result.

- we can implement a trait on a type only if either the trait or the type is local to our crate. This restriction is part of a property of programs called coherence, and more specifically the orphan rule, so named because the parent type is not present.

- Associated methods do not have self as a parameter. They are used for creating new instance of struct.

- Note that it isnâ€™t possible to call the default implementation from an overriding implementation of that same method. 

- Lifetime annotations: some scope can be substituted for 'a that will satisfy this signature.

- Every reference has a lifetime and that you need to specify lifetime parameters for functions or structs that use references.

- Most of the time, the lifetime problem results from attempting to create a dangling reference or a mismatch of the available lifetimes.

- Iterators produce a series of values, and we can call the collect method on an iterator to turn it into a collection.

- Lifetime annotation: The data returned by the function will live as long as the data passed into the function in the argument.
